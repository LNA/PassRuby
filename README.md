PassRuby
========
I made this for my newbie friends.  I want to help them learn test driven development and Ruby.

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into the repository (`cd PassRuby/`)

3. Install the gem dependencies (`bundle install`)

4. Start up guard (`guard`)

5. Once you are inside of guard, running rspec will start with the first test and work your way through each exercise.  If you'd rather focus on a specific section, such as the refactoring exercises, do not use guard.  Instead, try
 
    rspec/spec/refactor

6. Write code in the lib directory to make each failing spec pass
