PassRuby
========
I made this for my newbie friends.  I want to help them learn test driven development and Ruby.  

First: Clone the repo

Second: cd into whatever directory you want to work on. 

Third: Run the specs.  Make them pass one by one.

Fourth: * pretend there is something clever here *

Fifth: Give me feedback!
