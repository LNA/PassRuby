PassRuby
========
I made this for my newbie friends.  I want to help them learn test driven development and Ruby.

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into the repository (`cd PassRuby/`)

3. Install the gem dependencies (`bundle install`)

4. Start up guard (`guard`)

5. Once you are inside of guard, running rspec will start with the first test and work your way through each exercise.  If you'd rather focus on a specific section, such as the refactoring exercises, do not use guard.  Instead, try
 
    rspec/spec/refactor


6. Choose a directory (array, hash) to work on and save one of the files for guard to start listening

7. Write code in the lib directory to make each failing spec pass

9. Give me feedback!
