PassRuby
========
I made this for my newbie friends.  I want to help them learn test driven development and Ruby.

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into the repository 
    `cd PassRuby/`

3. Install the gem dependencies 
    `bundle install`

4. Start up guard 
    `guard`

5. Once you are inside of guard, running rspec will start with the first test and work your way through each exercise.  If you'd rather focus on a specific section, such as the refactoring exercises, do not use guard.  Instead, in your command line type:
 
    `rspec/spec/string`

This will start you off on the string section of PassRuby.  You can do the same for any directory of your choosing.

6. Write code in the lib directory to make each failing spec pass


7. Send a pull request if you'd like to contribute! And Feedback is always welcome.
