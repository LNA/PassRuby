PassRuby
========
I made this for my newbie friends.  I want to help them learn test driven development and Ruby.

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into the repository (`cd PassRuby/`)

3. Install the gem dependencies (`bundle install`)

4. Start up guard (`guard`)

5. Choose a directory (array, hash) to work on and save one of the files for guard to start listening

6. Write code in the lib directory to make each failing spec pass

7. * pretend there is something clever here *

8. Give me feedback!
